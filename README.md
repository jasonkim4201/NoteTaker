# NoteTaker

This is a note taking app powered by MySql and Express!

Here you can add notes to remind you for whatever you want and they will automatically be posted onto the page. When you no longer need to be reminded or need the note you can press the header/trashcan button. 

Careful deleting the notes will deleting the remove them for good!

### Future implementations

Will plan on making so you can edit your notes on the spot. For now just pretend that you wrote these notes down on pen and you can't edit them. Sorry!
